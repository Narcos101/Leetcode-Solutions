1.Brute force, naive where i use two loops for every substring and check whether they are valid or not. TC-O(N * N * 26) SC- O(26)
2.Divide and conquer method for every number which occurs less than k times i can break the loop and check for the left substring and similarily for the right substring.
3.Sliding window
